![Estimation of Predicted Occupancy Grid Maps](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1bfb0806-9448-4d95-9f00-f591cfc2a9bd)

## Overview

The `Highway` directory contains code, scripts, and/or data related to the motion prediction of traffic participants based on the publicly available [highD](https://levelxdata.com/highd-dataset/) dataset. 
The source code for the extraction and generation of predicted Occupancy Grid Maps (pOGMs) based on model based and machine learning based approaches are provided. 

## üìÅ Folder Structure

- `dataGeneration/`: Source code files for the generation of pOGMs from the highD dataset based on the model based approach.  
- `trainML/`: Source code files for the training and validation of machine learning algorithms. 
- `algorithmValidation/`: Validation of the proposed algorithm based on different metrics. 


## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Prerequisites**  
   - Matlab (tested on v2023.b)
   - Python (3.12)
   - Tensorflow (2.8) and related libraries (Refer to [requirements.txt](requirements.txt))
2. **Usage**  
   - Download the publicly available highD dataset from the above provided link.
   - Store the downloaded data with folder name data/ under the folder [dataGeneration](dataGeneration/).
   - Run the script ``` generateData.m ``` in Matlab environment.
   - This will generate the data (augmented Occupancy Grid Maps and predicted Occupancy Grid Maps) based on model based approach in a folder named generatedData/.
   - Navigate to the [trainML](trainML/) folder. 
   - Run the script ``` python trainML.py ``` to train the machine learning algorithms.
   - After training, run the script ``` python validateML.py ``` to validate the machine learning algorithms on a test set.
